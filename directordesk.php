It gives us immense pleasure to welcome you all to this temple of knowledge. When we take your precious children under our wings, we realize the gravity of the responsibility we owe. We have been, over the years, fulfilling this responsibility to the fullest. Any child who enters the portals of G.P. INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, leaves the school after 14 years as a fully developed wholesome personality who is ready to face any challenge thrown to him.
Education for us is never textbook centric. I would like to quote Mark Twain here, “Education is what remains with you even after you have forgotten everything that you learned in school.” We act as catalysts to invigorate and stimulate the heavenly curiosity every child is blessed with.</p></div>
